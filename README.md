# BIOFIGHTERS_DEV

basicly the game will be built off two mini games and one bigger type of levelthe two mini games: macrophag level: the macropagh catches random pathogens until a special kind of pathogen who the body didnt see before appears, the macropagh catches it and passes it to a dandritic cell which is the character we control in the next minigame, in the next minigame the dandritic cell travels to the closest lymph node and has to search for the right T cell for this specific pathogen, the t helper cell stars in the bigger level, he awakens all the different defense cells (the B cells, Macropagh, neutrophiles...), each with its unique abilities, and they in turn kill the pathogens, and the game loops these 3 phases a couple of times, each time with a different stronger pathogen and a higher diffuculty
