# BIOFIGHTERS

## Overview
**BIOFIGHTERS** is an action-packed educational game that immerses players in the world of the immune system. Players take control of different immune cells, each with unique roles, to defend the body against increasingly dangerous pathogens. The game is structured into two mini-games and one larger level, forming a continuous cycle that mimics real immune responses.

## Gameplay Structure
### 1. **Macrophage Level** (Mini-Game 1)
- The player controls a **macrophage**, an immune cell responsible for engulfing harmful pathogens.
- The macrophage catches various pathogens until a **novel pathogen** appearsâ€”one that the body has never encountered before.
- The macrophage engulfs the novel pathogen and passes it to a **dendritic cell**, setting up the next phase of the game.

### 2. **Dendritic Cell Level** (Mini-Game 2)
- The player now controls a **dendritic cell**, whose job is to carry the novel pathogen through the **lymph node maze**.
- Once in the lymph node, the player must identify the correct **T cell** that can recognize and respond to this pathogen.
- Successfully finding the right T cell triggers the activation of the immune defense.

### 3. **T Helper Cell Level** (Main Level)
- The player takes on the role of a **T helper cell**, which activates various immune defenses.
- The T helper cell awakens specialized immune cells, including:
  - **B cells** (produce antibodies to neutralize pathogens)
  - **Macrophages** (engulf and digest pathogens)
  - **Neutrophils** (attack and destroy invaders with toxic enzymes)
  - **Dandritic Cells** (sweep and engulf pathogens)

- These immune cells then work together to eliminate the invading pathogens.

## Game Loop
- The game cycles through these three phases multiple times.
- Each cycle introduces **stronger pathogens** and **higher difficulty levels**, requiring faster responses and strategic use of immune cells.

## Features
- **Dynamic Difficulty**: The game adjusts as the player progresses, making each cycle more challenging.
- **Unique Abilities**: Different immune cells have distinct skills, encouraging strategic gameplay.
- **Educational Elements**: Players learn about immune system functions in an interactive way through the MicroPedia.

## Lets Play!
**BIOFIGHTERS** is both an entertaining and educational experience, blending action with scientific accuracy. Are you ready to take control of the body's immune defenses and fight off the toughest pathogens?
