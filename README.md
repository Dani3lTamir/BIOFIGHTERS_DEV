# BIOFIGHTERS

## Overview
**BIOFIGHTERS** is an action-packed educational game that immerses players in the world of the immune system. Players take control of different immune cells, each with unique roles, to defend the body against increasingly dangerous pathogens. The game is structured into two mini-games and one larger level, forming a continuous cycle that mimics real immune responses.

## Gameplay Structure
### 1. **Macrophage Level** (Mini-Game 1)
- The player controls a **macrophage**, an immune cell responsible for engulfing harmful pathogens.
- The player answers Trivia questions about the immune system to obtain various power-ups.
- The macrophage catches various pathogens until a **novel pathogen** appears—one that the body has never encountered before.
- The macrophage engulfs the novel pathogen and passes it to a **dendritic cell**, setting up the next phase of the game.

### 2. **Dendritic Cell Level** (Mini-Game 2)
- The player now controls a **dendritic cell**, whose job is to carry the novel pathogen's **Antigen** through the **lymph node maze**.
- Once in the lymph node, the player must identify the correct **T cell** that has the right **Antibody** for our pathogen's Antigen.
- Successfully finding the right T cell triggers the activation of the immune defense (Final stage in a cycel).

### 3. **T Helper Cell Level** (Main Level)
- The player takes on the role of a **T helper cell**, which activates various immune defenses.
- The T helper cell awakens specialized immune cells, including:
  - **B cells** (produce antibodies to neutralize pathogens)
  - **Macrophages** (engulf and digest pathogens)
  - **Neutrophils** (attack and destroy invaders with toxic enzymes)
  - **Dandritic Cells** (sweep and engulf pathogens)

- These immune cells then work together to eliminate the invading pathogens (**Ecoli, Salmonela, Tuberculosis, Covid-19**) each with it's unique abilities.

## Game Loop
- The game cycles through these three phases multiple times.
- Each cycle introduces **stronger pathogens** and **higher difficulty levels**, requiring faster responses and strategic use of immune cells.

## Leaderboard

- Each cycle introduces **stronger pathogens** and **higher difficulty levels**, requiring faster responses and strategic use of immune cells.


## Features
- **Dynamic Difficulty**: The game adjusts as the player progresses, giving a ligther experience for **rookies**, and a more difficult one for **expirienced** players.
- **Unique Abilities**: Different immune cells have distinct skills, encouraging strategic gameplay.
- **Educational Elements**: Players learn about immune system functions in an interactive way through the **MicroPedia** - an interactive wiki that explains every Biological/Chemical element in the game.
- **Leaderboard**: Want to know how your run compares to other players around the world? At the end of the campaign you'll get an aggregated score of your performance in the different leves, submit your score up on the **Leaderboard**!
  


## 1v1 Multiplayer Mode
In **1v1 Multiplayer Mode**, two players battle for control over the body's cell tissues:

- **Player 1 (T Helper Cell Player)**: Controls the **T helper cell**, summoning defender immune cells to protect the body.
- **Player 2 (Pathogen Player)**: Summons **pathogens** to invade and destroy the cell tissues.

### Pathogens
The pathogen player can summon four types of pathogens, each with unique abilities:
- **E. coli** – Sworms the tissues and weakens defenses.
- **Salmonella** – Attack cells with severe damage.
- **Tuberculosis (TB)** – Hides inside Macrophages to reach the cells like a Trojan.
- **COVID-19** – Camoflage Among the defense cells, multiplies unpredictably when destroying body tissues.

### Defender Cells
The T helper cell player can summon the following immune defenders:
- **B cells** – Produce antibodies to neutralize pathogens.
- **Macrophages** – Engulf and digest invading pathogens.
- **Neutrophils** – Attack enemies with toxic enzymes.
- **Dendritic Cells** – Sweep up and engulf pathogens.

### Objective
- **T Helper Cell Player** wins if they successfully defend the body until the timer runs out.
- **Pathogen Player** wins if they manage to eliminate all tissue cells before time runs out.

### Energy System
- Both players use an **energy system** to summon their respective units.
- Stronger units require more energy, adding a layer of strategy to when and where units are deployed.



## Lets Play!
**BIOFIGHTERS** is both an entertaining and educational experience, blending action with scientific accuracy. Are you ready to take control of the body's immune defenses and fight off the toughest pathogens?
